=======================
Release version 7.4.0

For the most part the changes were contributed to the Bacula 
project by Bacula Systems SA.

This is a new release with a new version number. It has been
very thoroughly tested, but as always, the new features may not
always work as expected.

The Catalog database format has not changed since version the
prior release (7.2.0).

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Community Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded
at the same time.  Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 7.4.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons.

================================================================
Release version 7.2.0

Bacula code: Total files = 733 Total lines = 303,426
The diff between Bacula 7.0.6 and Bacula 7.2.0 is 254,442
which represents very large change, for the most part 
contributed to the Bacula project by Bacula Systems SA.

This is a major new release with many new features and a
number of changes. Please take care to test this code carefully
before putting it into production.  Although the new features
have been tested, they have not run in a production environment.

============== !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ===================
New Catalog format in version 7.2.0 and greater
-----------------------------------------------
This release of Bacula uses a new catalog format.  We provide a script
(update_bacula_tables in bacula/src/cats and in bacula/updatedb) that
will update from Bacula 3.x, 5.2, or 7.0 to version 7.2.0 format.
The database upgrade is fast and simply.  As always we strongly 
recommand that you make a dump of your database prior to doing the
upgrade.

NOTE: The upgrade will work only for PostgreSQL and MySQL. Upgrading is
not (yet) supported for SQLite3.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


For packagers, if you change options, naming, and the way 
we link our shared object files, as at least one of you does,
you are creating a situation where the user may not be able
to run multiple versions of Bacula on the same machine, which
is often very useful, and in addition, you create a configuration
that the project cannot properly support.

Please note that the documentation has significantly changed.
You will need additional packages to build it such as inkscape.
Please see the README and README.pct files in the docs directory.
The packages come with pre-build English pdf and html files,
which are located in the docs/docs/manuals/en/pdf-and-html directory.

Packagers: please note that the Bacula LICENSE has changed, it is still
AGPLv3 and still open source. A new requirement has been added which
requires other projects using the source to keep the acreditations.

Packagers: please note that the docs license has changed. It is now 
licensed: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
This is a common open source license.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Community Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded
at the same time.  Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 7.2.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons. However,
this has not been fully tested yet.  Since we expect some problems, please 
test before putting it into production.

New Features:
Please see the New Features chapter of the manual for documentation on
the new features.  The new features are currently only in the New Features
chapter and have not yet been integrated into the main chapters of the
manual.  Also, since there were so many new features, it is possible that
a few that previously existed in version 7.0.x are documented a second
time in the 7.2.0 new features section.

Release 7.0.0

 Bacula code: Total files = 713 Total lines = 305,722
 The diff between Bacula 5.2.13 and Bacula 7.0.0 is 622,577 lines,
 which represents very large change.

This is a major new release with many new features and a
number of changes. Please take care to test this code carefully
before putting it into production.  Although the new features
have been tested, they have not run in a production environment.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For packagers, if you change options, naming, and the way 
we link our shared object files, as at least one of you does,
you are creating a situation where the user may not be able
to run multiple versions of Bacula on the same machine, which
is often very useful, and in addition, you create a configuration
that the project cannot properly support.

Please note that the documentation has significantly changed.
You will need additional packages to build it such as inkscape.
Please see the README and README.pct files in the docs directory.
The packages come with pre-build English pdf and html files,
which are located in the docs/docs/manuals/en/pdf-and-html directory.

Packagers: please note that the Bacula LICENSE has changed, it is still
AGPLv3 and still open source. A new requirement has been added which
requires other projects using the source to keep the acreditations.

Packagers: please note that the docs license has changed. It is now 
licensed: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
This is a common open source license.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
